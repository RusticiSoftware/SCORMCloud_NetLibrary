SCORM Cloud Service .Net Library
Rustici Software

About:
The SCORM Cloud .Net Library is a C# library intended to aid in the integration of the SCORM Cloud service API into .Net 2.0+ applications.  This library does not cover all possible SCORM Cloud service API calls, but it does cover the basics. Descriptions of the full API can be found here: http://cloud.scorm.com/EngineWebServices/doc/SCORMCloudAPI.html

Using the Library:
To use the library, open the project in Visual Studio and perform a build.  Then add a reference to the library dll to your integration project solution.

There is also a .Net Demo application available for download here: https://github.com/RusticiSoftware/SCORMCloud_NetDemoApp
The demo app is meant to provide examples for how to use many of the basic library calls.
